	"description" => "Kepot furniture is designed for children between two and seven years, with the aim of
					promoting the playful and creative development. The body of each piece of furniture is 
					made of processed wood, painted by hand, with glossy, durable and resistant surface 
					finish, and it preserves the purity of the colors selected for each Kepot. The conical legs, 
					distinctive elements of this design, are made of solid wood, lined with silkscreened 
					fabrics designed by different Argentine textile design entrepreneurs. This furniture not 
					only proposes creativity in its use, but also in the genesis of Kepot on its own as it 
					allows the combination of different colors and genders.",
